"""
Basic Sorting Algorithm to sort list in ascending order

Ex:
Inital:  [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
Goal : [2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]

Diving the list into two sub lists within the array
 - not actually creating new arrays

List 1 - unsorted items
List 2 - sorted items

Intially all items are in List 1
Each time we iterate through list 1 we will search for the smallest number
- when found we append it to the start list 2


 [ 8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
   |
start with 8: 8 > 5 = move

 [ 8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
        |
5: 5 > 2 = move

 [ 8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
            |
2: 2 < 9  = keep 2 as smallest
2: 2 < 5  = keep 2 as smallest
2: 2 < 6  = keep 2 as smallest
2: 2 < 3  = keep 2 as smallest

End iteration 1: 2 is the smallest number in this list
- swap the 2 with first element in the unsorted list which is itâ€™s final position
[2, 5, 8, 9, 5, 6, 3]

Keep going with iteration.

End result : [2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]

Space and Time complexity:
Space: O(1)
- using the same array

Time: O(n^2)
- where n = lenght of the array
- we have to keep reinterating through the unsorted sub list
